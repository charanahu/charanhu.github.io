## Description
In this project, The dataset consists of 10015 dermatoscopic images which
are released as a training set for academic machine learning
purposes and are publicly available through the ISIC archive. Here, I'm using RGB pixel values of that images(each image of
size 28*28, so total 784*3 pixel in each row). The objective to
build deep learning model to classify given query image into
one of the 7 different classes of skin cancer.

Furthermore, beam search is used during inference to enhance the prediction result. The network was trained in **PyTorch** on an **Nvidia GTX 1060** graphics card for over 80 epochs.

Model is deployed on heroku cloud.

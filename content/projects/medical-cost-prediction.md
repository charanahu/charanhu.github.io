## Description
Medical insurance cost prediction using Machine Learning with Python. For this project, I have used Linear Regression model.

![Model Architecture](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*ssbGU5VIxtVB6NrF)

I have used the USA's medical cost personal dataset from kaggle, having 1338 entries. Features in the dataset that are used for the prediction of insurance cost include: Age, Gender, BMI, Smoking Habit, number of children etc. We used linear regression and also determined the relation between price and these features. I trained the system using a 70-30 split and achieved an accuracy of 81.3%.

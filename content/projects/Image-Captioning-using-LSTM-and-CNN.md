## Description
Describing an image is the problem of generating a human-readable textual description of an image, such as a photograph of an object or scene. It combines both computer vision and natural language processing together.

Neural network models for captioning involve two main elements:
1. Feature Extraction.
2. Language Model.

The dataset used can be downloaded using the following links.

Flickr8k_Dataset(Contains 8092 photographs in JPEG format) â€” https://bit.ly/35shVWb

Flickr8k_text(Contains a number of files containing different sources of descriptions for the photographs.) â€” https://bit.ly/2DcBAgF

The dataset has a pre-defined training dataset (6,000 images), a development dataset (1,000 images), and test dataset (1,000 images).

The dataset information as well as data preparation for the model can be seen in the same link above.

Here, we will only show the important snippets of the code that has been used to create and run the model. You are encouraged to use a different dataset and prepare your dataset accordingly.

### Feature extraction
The feature extraction model is a neural network that given an image is able to extract the salient features, often in the form of a fixed-length vector. A deep convolutional neural network, or CNN, is used as the feature extraction submodel. This network can be trained directly on the images in your dataset. Alternatively, you can use a pre-trained convolutional model as shown.

### Language Model
For image captioning, we are creating an LSTM based model that is used to predict the sequences of words, called the caption, from the feature vectors obtained from the VGG network.

### Conclusion
A CNN-LSTM architecture has wide-ranging applications as it stands at the helm of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. It allows us to use state of the art neural models for NLP tasks such as the transformer for sequential image and video data. At the same time, extremely powerful CNN networks can be used for sequential data such as the natural language. Hence, it allows us to leverage the useful aspects of powerful models in tasks they have never been used for before. This post was just to introduce the concept of hybrid neural models and encourage the people to increasingly use different architectures of the CNN-LSTM models.
